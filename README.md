# demo-element

This file is generated by [web-component-analyzer](https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer) and is intended to illustrate [issue 152 from that repo](https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer/issues/152).

To re-generate this file, run `npm run analyze`. The desired behavior is that the `greeting` prop below should reflect the data in [`typings/Greeting.ts`](typings/Greeting.ts).

## Properties

| Property   | Attribute  | Type       | Default | Description          |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|----------------------|
| `greeting` | `greeting` | `Greeting` | ""      | Who should we greet? |
